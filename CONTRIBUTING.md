# How to Contribute

## Philosophy

As you can see the Hanoi experiment is a simple html page that live on UI sexiness alone.  
Every change you make is expected to keep the UI and interface as smooth as possible.  

This is an experiment so feel free to add features that do new stuff.  
Look into the issues section in the repo to get an idea of what changes are Pending.

## To contribute

* Create your own fork of the repo / clone the repo
* Make your modifications
* Create commits that contain a really brief summary of what you have done  
  add details inside if you think it needs explanation: this reduces further discussion on your changes
* Create a Pull Request to merge your changes to my master
* I shall look into the code and approve it or request you to change it if there's something awkward about it.

Happy Coding!
